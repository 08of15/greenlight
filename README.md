## Installation on BigBlueButton
We've created a Docker image to make it easy to install GreenLight on a BigBlueButton 1.1-beta (or later server).  See [Installing GreenLight](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/1.1/green-light.html) in the BigBlueButton documentation.

# Development

GreenLight is a rails 5 application.
