# Step 1 - Create a secret key for rails
#
# You can generate a secure one through the Greenlight docker image
# with with the command
#
#   docker run --rm bigbluebutton/greenlight rake secret
#
SECRET_KEY_BASE=

# Step 2 - Enter credentials for your BigBlueButton Server
#
# The endpoint and secret from your bigbluebutton server.  To get these values, run
# the following command on your BigBlueButton server
#
#    bbb-conf --secret
#
# and uncomment the following two variables
#BIGBLUEBUTTON_ENDPOINT=
#BIGBLUEBUTTON_SECRET=


# If "true", GreenLight will register a webhook callback for each meeting
# created. This callback is called for all events that happen in the meeting,
# including the processing of its recording. These events are used to update
# the web page dynamically as things happen in the server.
# If not "true", the application will add a metadata to the meetings with this same
# callback URL. Scripts can then be added to BigBlueButton to call this callback
# URL and send specific events to GreenLight (e.g. a post publish script to warn
# the application when recordings are done).
